# terminate
Program for ASCII art font animation

Proof of concept:

This streamlines something that would be rather tedious in C, especially when 
one wants a variety of fonts and animations. Terminate aims to be easy to interface with
and works by outputting a single string per tick. I would also like to explore a more 
combinatorial animation system.
